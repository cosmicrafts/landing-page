# Download

Download the project either as .zip or with `git clone`

# Install project

Open a terminal inside the project's folder and run

### `npm install`

## Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Will run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Structure

Inside the project you will find the next sctructure (among other things that we can ignore unless you know what you are doing)

>src

>src / css /

>src / resources /
    
>src / sections /

>src / App.js

>src / index.js

All the css files should go inside the css folder

All resources should go inside the resources folder

All code should go inside an individual folder for each section inside the sections folder

You can import your sections in App.js in the order it should be displayed

### Important notes

You should comment on the first line of each section file your name (nickname, username, name or something) to identify you created that file and all questions can be asked to you

If you are going to modify other user's file, first let them know

You can create as many folders inside each folder already created for your own needs, just respect the actual structure

## Build for Prod

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
