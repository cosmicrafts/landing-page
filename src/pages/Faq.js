                <h3>What is your take and prediction on the Gamification space?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gaming Industry is huge and ever growing. As technology evolves we will see a big transition from Web2 games to Web3, no doubt.</li>
                    <li>Our take on Gamification is to go Mobile and Web3 with the already successful Free-to-Play with in-game transactions business model.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What do you think are the most important elements in a gamifi project?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The most important element is having a prototype ready to use, the demo showcases the skills of the team and the possibility to directly validate the project before going to market.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What do players and traders respectively want most？</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Players and Traders are two different separate segments of the market. Traditionally, most Players are looking for entertainment while traders focus on the exchange of digital assets.</li>
                    <li>We can put this into perspective with World of Warcraft, where players pay around $15 per month plus $60+ for the game itself. Have a well-defined Web2 game economy where they can freely trade their assets internally but without the ability to really profit from it. Despite this fact, it’s been the most successful game in its genre since 2003.</li>

                <h3>Why Internet Computer?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The more you learn about the Internet Computer, the more it makes sense for developers to build a business model around it. Free transactions for users, low cost for developers and a great community just to name a few, but overall it’s the most advanced Blockchain technology, no doubt about it.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Do you think all on-chain is necessary?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>No, right now the technology is very new. In our case, we built the first Web3 real-time server but it wasn’t exactly the best solution for the nature of the game. At the same time other projects might have a different approach on their needs and can be fully on-chain.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Do you have any plan to do cross-chain integration? If so, could you elaborate it, please?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Yes, we have Bitcoin and Ethereum integration coming up for the Internet Computer. This opens up a whole new market for the ecosystem that didn’t exist before.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Cosmicrafts started as a written story back in 2016 while Omar was in video game school, that’s where he met Moises, with the help of other developers and artists we built our first demo in January 2017 and since then the game has been through several iterations over the years until what you see now. In 2021 we added Frank, a new co-founder committed to Web3 development. Our new approach as a Startup is to keep the team small and exclusive to driven and professional people with integrity, wanting to take this to a new level.</li>
